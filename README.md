**TWEET SENTIMENT ANALYSIS PROGRAM**

To run: 
- Change the working directory on line 16 to wherever you downloaded the "elon-tweet-analysis" folder to
- Run all by hitting ctrl-alt-R

Notes:
- Could modify this program to do sentiment analysis on any sorts of texts that change over time
- Sentiment analysis is based off of number of "positive" and "negative" words
	- In the future, would like to expand this to give an emotion back - such as "sad", "excited", etc.
